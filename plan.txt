STEPS TO CREATE ASCII 3D RENDERER
1. Coordinate System
    --- * Representing numeral coordinates in a 2D space
    --- * Data Structures to contain points with evolution for edges and faces
    --- * Converting coordinates to world coordinates (within the string)
    * Graph axes
    * Create Data Structure for Faces
    --- * in bounds function
    
2. Line Renderer
    --- * Graph edges
    --- * Use line drawing algorithm

3. Project 3D coordinates onto 2D spaces

4. Create shape class
    * edges, faces, and lines encompassed within this class
    * easy shortcut to define shapes without having to thinking about it too hard
    * make it triangle-based to allow backface culling to work the best

4b. Organize points in clockwise order
    * Check if any clockwise order will do
    * Apply backface culling to it

4c. Math Functions
    * Cross Product
    * Dot Product
    * Matrix Mult

5. Backface culling
    * Research it more and how it works
    * Implement it
    * Optimize it to work with more shapes
